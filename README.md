This is the Github repository for the "Detecting Market Structure Using Long-Short
Term Memory Neural Networks" project completed during the "DS340: Introduction to Machine Learning and AI" course at Boston University's Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences in the Fall 2025 semester, authored by Yulian Gogov and Sviatoslav Shevchenko. Above you can see the various project components sorted into relevant folders, below will be a short summary of instructions on how to reproduce the project. 


The project has fundamentally two parts: Technical and Sentiment, which first start separately and eventually merge later on before the construction of the final LSTM.

How to run?

Option 1 Steps: 
1. Run the Sentiment part in full
2. Run the Technical part in full

Option 2 Steps: 
1. Run the Technical part until "IMPORT SENTIMENT"
2. Run the Sentiment part in full
